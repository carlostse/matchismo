Mobile Apps Design and Implementation Assignment 2

Well tested on iOS 6 and 7, Xcode 4.6.3 and 5.0.2

1. End game algorithm is implemented, i.e., the game can be played for infinite times
   without restart.

2. 4 x 3 rows, total 12 cards with empty value will be created when the Apps started.
   After user flips a card, a random value will generated and assigned to the card.

3. A NSDictionary is used to prevent duplicate value. If duplicated, the value will be
   re-generated. Only the unique value will be assigned to the card.

4. Thanks to the empty value, the end-game checking algorithm is easier. The game will
   be ended if and only if all cards have to be flipped at least once and no matching
   can be done. By checking the empty value, we can ensure all cards have been flipped.

5. In this game, the max. remaining cards will be 4 because if more than 4 cards
   remains, at least one matching can be performed. By comparing the remaining cards,
   the end-game can be detected.

6. Card's function "- (CardCompareResult)compare:(Card *)card" is used to compare
   another card.

7. CoreData (SQLite) is used for storing high scores. When user finished a game,
   the mark will be inserted. After sorting, the rank after 5th will be removed.
   Also, the fetch limit is set to 5, such that only the top 5 scores will be shown.
